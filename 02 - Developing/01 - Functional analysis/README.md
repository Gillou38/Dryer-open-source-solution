# Functional analysis

## Vocabulary
- The need: is the goal of a product
- Function: a function is an action, a service or a constraint of a product
- Interactor: all element which have a contact or a relation with the product
- Phase: different using phase (using phase, supplying phase, cleaning phase â€¦)


## The aim
The functional analysis is a design method which divise the need of a product, or a service, in different functions to create a group of very simple studies.

## The process
The process is decompose in different analysis :
- Phase analysis: the phase correspond to the different kind of using of the product, like using phase, supplying phase, cleaning phase ... For each phase, different function can appeared and exist only for that phase.
- Octopus diagram: representation of the product, the study, and the interactor, all ellement in relation with the product. Each interaction, will be defined by a function of the product.
