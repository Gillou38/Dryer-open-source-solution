# Contribution guide

Project access is open to all people want to contribute, read, be inspire or else for his/her personnal or professionnal work. So to make a product which can be used by a maximum of person, we need a maximum of different people.

If you want to take part during either activities of the group, you're welcome, even if you don't have any technical competence, we can explain to you, what we do, or how you can participate without technical background.

That project will be organize in different operations :
1) Promote the project, speak about the project
2) [Propose ideas to develop](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/issues) and report creation 
3) [Developing](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/tree/master/02%20-%20Developing)
- [Formalize technical problems](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/tree/master/02%20-%20Developing/01%20-%20Functional%20analysis) (Functional analysis)
- Propose and develop technical solution (FAST - Function Analysis System Technique)
- Design technical solution (CAD)
- Model the product to create physical model
- Writing documentation to fabricate the product
4) Protyping, test and analyse results
5) Produce the project, make and sell the product or educate people to make it

## 1) Promoting, speaking 
All kinds of contribution are wellcome, speak about the project, report dryers make.

## 2) How to propose an idea and reporting a creation
### 2.1) Propose an idea
Actually the simpler solution is to post an [issue](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/issues). 
Once create, may be to speak about that proposition like on a forum, detailled it, modify it ...
### 2.2) 

## 3) Developping
It's the bigger part of the project, it begin with statement of the need, the aim of the product and finish with prototyping documentation.
### 3.1) Functional analysis
- Formalise technical problems : "How we want to the product work ?" :
For that we distinguish different phase :
  - Using phase
  - Clean phase
  ...

For each phase, we create functions which can describe precise need. Generally, they're 3 kind of functions :
  - Principal function : that's the aim of the product, ~ Dry food
  - Using functions : that's optimisation functions for a good utilisation of the system, like "Be ergonomic"
  - Constraint functions : that the limit of the other functions, like "Don't burn food"

- Develope (and propose) technical solutions
We use FAST diagram for that. It's an abstract technic to generate and organize technical functions and technical solutions.

- Choice of technical solutions 
We use, SADT diagram. It's a more concrete solution, which place each action in relation to other action, and make plan of the process.


## 4) Prototyping

## 5) Producing
