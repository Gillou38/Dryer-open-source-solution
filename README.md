# Dryer-open-source-solution
Develop a dietary dryer, which can articulate solar and electrical energy. Prefering develop for professionnal farmer to get liberty and technical autonomy.

## Project presentation
### Why this project ?
This project is an help for each producer of vegetables, plants, fruits or other kinds of food who wants to transform his/her product with drying solution.

Very usefull for production of aromatic or medicinal plants, the dryer let to the producer, more of freedom to organize his/her selling and enabling himself/herself to respect natural season of production.

It can be use, by fruits and vegetables producers, to transform and valorise a lot of kinds of product and diversify his/her production.

### Why open source ?
Today, for a farmer, his/her technical dependance can be a real problem to have a stable life. So, we positionning us to developped the farmer autonomy by the knowledge and the know-how about the farm's tools, and specially the dryer. So that product need to make simply by DIY, or by indrustrial process and let free the farmer to optimize, modify or repare his/her product like he/she want.

With open source logic, there necessary documentation, which explain, how the product work and how it can be made, to conserv the four fondamental liberty of open source :
- Freedom to study: the right to access enough information to understand how the piece of hardware (referred herein as the product) works and to retrace the logic behind its design;
- Freedom to modify: the right to edit the product definition documents and to tweak or develop the product further for any purpose;
- Freedom to make: the right to use the product definition documents to manufacture the piece of hardware;
- Freedom to distribute: the right to share or sell the product definition documents as well as the physical products fabricated according to these documents.

For our application, we choose to protect all our documentation production by a GNU GPL v3, and our design production by a CERN Open Hardware Licence V1.2.

### Where we want to go ?
To let free the producer, we want to develop a scaling method to let the producer to make his own dryer, apply for his utilisation, and in his premise. So by developing a standard dryer, we want to expand it to a group of solution, and make generic plan to create infinity solutions adapt to each producer.

## Drying 
It's a physicochemical reaction, which extract water of something. For dietary application, the reaction need to be control to conserv nutriment, but for a professionnal, the reaction need to be fast. So in our development, we try to mix that 2 constraints, to optimize the process.

Drying is the 1st method use to conserve food, because that transformation keep a good concentration of nutriment, and reduce weight and volume.

### History
That technic begin with the beginning of the agriculture, around 12 000 B. C. by inhabitants of the modern Middle East and Asia region. In beginning drying was realize by evaporation (air drying, sun drying ...). With time and technical evolution, there's actually a lot of different technic to dry food, from very low tech solution to high tech solution.

### Composition of a dryer
A dryer is compose of a drying room, where food can be stocked and dispose to be dried. In that room, there is a dry  airflow, by natural or forced convection, which flow around food to capture water present in the food. 

For the more basic dryer, the drying room is the heating component, and the ventillation is make by wind, so all of the product is in only one room.

For more complex solution

### Different systems
For each soluti

#### Drying room
Dietary material
Couche mince/couche Ã©paisse

#### Heat system
Solar (direct, indirect)
electrical
Warm and pollute flow (biomass, wood combustion, oil ...) => echangeur thermique

- Inertial system

#### Convection system
- Natural
- Forced

#### Air flow drying system :
- Renouvellement de l'air
- Condensation
- Absorption

### Our position
We want to use at best low tech and low energy consommation solution when that is possible, and use other efficient solution when we need. Actually, we oriente the development around a solar solution with electrical assistance and regulation which let free a professionnal producer to dry his/her production when he/she want, even if solar energy isn't optimal.

### Optimisation to keep nutriment
A lot of study is realised around quality of food, and conservation of nutrument during transformation. Another secondary goal is to optimise and document how technical choice change the nutriment conservation.
