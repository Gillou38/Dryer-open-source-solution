# Contribution guide

The access to that project is open to all people want to contribute, read, be inspire or else for his/her personnal or professionnal work. So to make a product which can be used by a maximum of person, we need a maximum of different people.

If you want to take part during either activities of the group, you're welcome, even if you don't have any technical competence, we can explain to you, what we do, or how you can participate without technical background.

That project will be organize in different operations :
1) Promote the project
2) Propose ideas to develop (Issue)
3) Developing
- Formalize technical problems (Functional analysis)
- Propose and develop technical solution (FAST - Function Analysis System Technique)
- Design technical solution (CAD)
- Model the product to create physical model
- Writing documentation to fabricate the product
4) Protyping, test and analyse results
5) Produce the project,make and sell the product or educate people to make it

## 1) Promoting

## 2) How to propose an idea
Actually the simpler solution is to post an issue (https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/issues). After it's possible to speak about that proposition like on a forum, detailled it, modify it ...

## 3) Developping
It's the bigger part of the project, it begin with tatement of the need, the aim of the product and finish with prototyping documentation.
- Formalise technical problems : "How we want to the product work ?" :
For that we distinguish different phase :
  - Using phase
  - Clean phase
  ...

For each phase, we create functions which can describe precise need. Generally, they're 3 kind of functions :
  - Principal function : that's the aim of the product, ~ Dry food
  - Using functions : that's optimisation functions for a good utilisation of the system, like "Be ergonomic"
  - Constraint functions : that the limit of the other functions, like "Don't burn food"

## 4) Prototyping

## 5) Producing
