# Functional analysis

## Vocabulary
- The need: is the goal of a product
- Function: a function is an action, a service or a constraint of a product
- Interactor: all element which have a contact or a relation with the product
- Phase: different using phase (using phase, supplying phase, cleaning phase â€¦)


## The aim
The functional analysis is a design method which divise the need of a product, or a service, in different functions to create a group of very simple studies.

## The process
The process is decompose in different analysis :
**- Phase analysis:** the phase correspond to the different kind of using of the product, like using phase, supplying phase, cleaning phase ... In that part of the study, we list all of the phase. For each phase, different function can appeared and exist only for that phase.

For our study, we try to explore the most of solution at the beginning, to after, if we want, reduce the study to a few of function which interess us. The aim of that practice is to open a maximum of solutions, and motivate people to realise complementary studies.

**- Octopus diagram**: representation of the product, the study, and the interactor, all ellement in relation with the product. Each interaction, will be defined by a function of the product :
- PF: principaly function, that's the need of the product
- UF: using fonction, that's the condition to have a good using of the product
- CF: constraint function, that's the limit of the using

**- Interactors characterisation:** now, we difined all interactors of the product, we describe the interactor, with important characteristic which influence study. In our practice, we try to make a modular and scaling model, the that part of the study, need to identified different group in each interactors which create a different product, write about that to let other group, peoples or we, later, develop complementary products.

**- Functions characterisation:** like with the interactor, we write important characteristic which influence study.
