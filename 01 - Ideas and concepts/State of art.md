# State of art

For basics category, we inspire by *“Les séchoirs solaires – Théorie et pratique”* de Michel Daguenet, because he made a huge work about drying science, and more applied to solar drying.
# Dryer for solid, centimetre scale
That document try to make an inventory of all kind of dryer, and technology which could be used to dry, from the convective drying to the freeze drying, and defined each technology (electric, solar ...) used in each kind of dryers. For the 2nd level category (convective, …) we choose to class them by kind of technology. Maybe, we can found a best classification.
## Convective drying
### 1. Global parameters
There is a lot of different kind of dryer, from the little dryer for domestic application to the huge dryer for industrial application.
#### A. Size
Actually we can’t precisely defined size in function of application, it depends of the food goods.
##### - Domestic
That’s kind of dryer could be used by a single man/women or a family for their own food.

![Domestic dryer](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Size%20-%20Domestic%20dryer.jpg)

##### - Little production
That size of dryer, is adapted to little company, people which want to sell product at local market.

![Little production dryer](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Size%20-%20Little%20production%20dryer.jpg)

##### - Industrial production
Dryer adapted for industrial production, sell product in large region.

![Industrial dryer](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Size%20-%20Industrial%20production%20dryer.jpg)

#### B. Organization
#####  - Mono-bloc
That kind of organisation could be a compact organization (like a multi-bloc organization hook together) or an all in drying room organization.

Advantages:
- easy to make, no pipe to link each part
- compact

Disadvantages:
- not transportable for middle size (size of a big wardrobe) of dryer
- 

![Compact organization](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Organization%20-%20compact%20organization.jpg)    ![All in drying room](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Organization%20-%20All%20in%20drying%20room.jpg)       ![All in drying room (2)](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Organization%20-%20All%20in%20drying%20room(2).jpg)

#####   - Multi-bloc
Advantages:
- can be move by part, maybe can be taken apart (démonté)

Disadvantages: 
- lost energy (temperature and airflow) in pipe

![Multi-bloc](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Organization%20-%20multi-bloc.jpg)

#### C. Transportable
##### 1) Fixed
We don’t imaged that kind of dryer because it could defined by a very large panel of dryer. So we consider in that category all dryer which can’t be transport by 2 or less humans.
##### 2) Transportable
######   - Portable
Defined by little dryer, which integrate handle or part which can be considered like handle, and which can be transport by maximum 2 peoples.

![Portable](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Transportable%20-%20Portable.jpg)

######   - Pliable
The same restriction than a “portable” dryer, which pliable part to make an easy to transport dryer when it necessary.

![Pliable](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Transportable%20-%20Pliable.png)

######   - Wheel
Dryer which integrate one or more wheel to transport it.

![2 Wheels](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Transportable%20-%20Wheels.jpg)

### 2. Drying room
#### A. Materials
##### - Stone – Building:
Dryer directly integrate in a building. It can vary from old building (like attic) to modern building with waxed concrete. For that part, we need to study alimentary laws to identified what kind of material could be used, almost sure waxed concrete is legal, the rest need more study.

![Traditional nuts dryer](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Materials%20-%20Stone%20building.jpg)

##### - Steel
The same than the precedent category for metal dryer. What kind of metal can be used, some stainless steels for sure, very probably some aluminium, but need more study to identify them precisely. 

![Stainless dryer](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Materials%20-%20steel%20-%20stainless.jpg)

##### - Wood:

![Wood dryer](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Materials%20-%20wood.jpg)

##### - Plastic

![Plastic dryer](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Materials%20-%20plastic.jpg)

##### - Varnish materials
What kind of varnish could be used, what the maximum rate of product could be used.
#### B. Form
That the very hard part of the state of art, a lot of forms of dryer was experiment since the first realisation 12 000 years before, so we try to make the most complete list of kind of dryer. 
Maybe there dryers which can be regroup in the same category but to be sure to list all kind of dryer, we separate all little difference.
##### - Shell type (indirect solar natural convection)

![Shell Type](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Materials%20-%20plastic.jpg)

##### - Vertical type with trays

![Vertical with trays](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Form%20-%20vertical%20type%20with%20trays.jpg)

##### - Spread type (solar direct):
Spread dryer, is a special form of vertical dryer, adapt to solar direct application, but it can be used in different case but that’s not real useful.

![Spread type](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Form%20-%20spread%20type.jpg)

##### - Tunnel type
That’s more or less the same system than spread type, but for that category we exclude direct solar input. So, all kind of heat source could be considered. 

![Tunnel type](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Form%20-%20tunnel%20type.jpg)     ![Tunnel type(2)](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Form%20-%20tunnel%20type(2).jpg)

##### - Rotative cylinder type
More adapted for cereals, and that kind of products. That kind of dryer is composed of a rotative drying room, which is crossed by an airflow. It provide to dry equitably all products.

![Rotative cylinder type](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Form%20-%20rotative%20cylinder%20type.jpg)     ![Rotative cylinder type](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Form%20-%20rotative%20cylinder%20type(2).jpg)

##### - Forklift - Mobile trays

![Mobile trays](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art%20-%20Picture/Drying%20rack%20-%20Forklift%20-%20Mobile%20trays.jpg)

### 4. Heat source
Heat source is one of technical problem of dryer. Between effectiveness and energy independence, there is a real work to search what kind of heat source to what kind of application, to optimize known heat source and to mix some kind of heat source.
#### A. Solar (warm and non pollute flow)
##### Kind of caption
###### Direct:

###### Indirect:
- Glassed
Simple or double glazing
Black absorber, alimentary paint?








- Opaque


###### Mixed (direct + indirect)






##### Other parameters
###### Positioning
Azimuth
Normal of the ground
###### Inertial system (conservation of energy)
Stone 


#### B. Electrical (resistor)











#### C. Warm and pollute flow
That kind of heat source need a heat exchanger to separate pollute flow and drying flow.
##### Heat exchanger 
(source: http://www.uk-exchangers.com/heat-exchange-products/air-to-air-heat-exchangers/)
Different kind of heat exchanger can be used to transfer energy from 1st fluid to a 2nd fluid. For beginning, we stay only in airflow exchanger.
###### Plate type







###### Thermal wheel type






###### Tubular type








##### Heat source
Compost
Oil combustion
Wood combustion


### 5. Convection
#### A. Kind
##### Natural: Work with rising warm airflow













##### Forced
###### Electrical

###### Wind forced




#### B. Direction
##### Perpendicular to the trays

###### Air repartition (plenum)
		- air flow breaker






		- room
	








##### Parallel to the trays




### 6. Dehumidifier 
#### A. Opened pipe
- Air exchange








#### B. Closed pipe
- Condensation







- Absorption









### 6. Alimentary legislation
