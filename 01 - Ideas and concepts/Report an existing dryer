How to report an existing dryer 
-------------------------------------

*Inspired from “Méthodologie TRIP” by l’Atelier Paysan*

We try to summarise information about dryers, so to the technical approach, the 1st thing to do is to report lot of different kinds of existing dryers.

On that document we try to explain how have enough informations for the report.
That way isn’t the only way to have enough information, the more important is the 3rd part, semi-structured interview.
We try to make it for industrial products and DIY products so, maybe the is some answer specific for each category.

# I) Know different kinds of dryer
To present a dryer is be good to know what kind of dryer already existing, for that you can go on internet or on our [state of art](https://github.com/Gillou38/Drying-open-source-solution/blob/master/01%20-%20Ideas%20and%20concepts/State%20of%20art.md), we try to make a good data base about dryers, and using technologies.

# II) Useful materials
- camera
- tape measure
- audio recorder
- takes notes and drawings

# III) Semi-structured interview
First, ask if you can record the interview if you want to do it.

### Principle
- Generic name link with using
- What the aim (drying fruits, plants, all kind of product...)
- That’s a DIY dryer?
######	- Why make it? (cheaper, custom product, pleasure, more simple)
######	- There is preliminary state before the fabrication (inspirations, drawings, plans…)
######	- What’s the development? (success, failure, questioning …)

### Making (for DIY)
- What’s the materials? (mechanical, electrical, new materials, raw material dump)
- tools and technique
- construction site’s organisation (time and space)
- price (approximate)
 
### Making (for industrial products)
- Constructor, reference …

### Using
- Technical characteristic
- Global size, between each components
	- kind of deshumidifer
	- heating system
	- convection system
	- ...
- How components work together (components organisation)
- Using process
	- Preparation
	- Using
	- End
- Danger

### Using feedback (for DIY)
- Evolution between the construction and now
- Difference between first idea and the using
- What could they do differently?
- Maintenance/using cost

### Using feedback (for industrial products)
- Difference between need and the using
- Maintenance/using cost

### Illustration
- Photo will be a good method to show the product
- Diagram for “how product works”
- photo during fabrication

### Contact
If we want to contact again the user, and if he’s agree.
