# Dryer-open-source-solution
Develop a dietary dryer, which can articulate solar and electrical energy. Prefering develop for professionnal farmer to get liberty and technical autonomy.

## Project presentation
### Why this project ?
This project is an help for each producer of vegetables, plants, fruits or other kinds of food who wants to transform his/her product with drying solution.
Very usefull for production of aromatic or medicinal plants, the dryer let to the producer, more of freedom to organize his/her selling and enabling himself/herself to respect natural season of production.
It can be use, by fruits and vegetables producers, to transform and valorise a lot of kinds of product and diversify his/her production.

### Why open source ?
Today, for a farmer, his/her technical dependance can be a real problem to have a stable life. So, we positionning us to developped the farmer autonomy by the knowledge and the know-how about the farm's tools, and specially the dryer. So that product need to make simply by DIY, or by indrustrial process and let free the farmer to optimize, modify or repare his/her product like he/she want.

### Where we want to go ?
To let free the producer, we want to develop a scaling method to let the producer to make his own dryer, apply for his utilisation, and in his premise. So by developing a standard dryer, we want to expand it to a group of solution, and make generic plan to create infinity solutions adapt to each producer.

## Drying 
It's a physicochemical reaction, which extract water of something. For dietary application, the reaction need to be control to conserv the nutriment, but for a professionnal, the reaction need to be fast produce. So in how development, we try to mix that 2 constraints, to optimize the process.
